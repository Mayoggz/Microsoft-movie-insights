    # Overview

    The main goal is to come up with insights that will help Microsoft start and excel in the movie business.

    # Business Understanding

    In response to the evolving landscape of the entertainment industry, Microsoft embarked on an initiative to establish its own movie studio. The objective was to explore the creation of original video content. This project will provide actionable insights to guide Microsoft's new movie studio in deciding what types of films to create and empower it to make informed decisions and establish a competitive position within the film industry.

     # Data Understanding

    There were various sources of data which include: Box Office Mojo, IMDB,  Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB and The Numbers. However, focus was mainly on the Box Office, The numbers and TheMovieDB datasets. The datasets contain columns and key variables helpful to our analysis;Movie title,original language,domestic gross,worlwide gross,popularity and production budget.

    # Data Analysis

    1. What is the most common movie language and does it affect the popularity of the movie? - We aim to provide insights by analyzing the average popularity metrics for films in different languages.

    The first chart illustrates the distribution of movies across various languages(Considered the top 10 languages). English is by far the most common language in which movies are produced. The other languages, have significantly fewer movies associated with them.The second chart illustrates the different languages and the degree of their popularity. English directed and spoken films are the most popular as per the dataset. Hence our conclusion is that English dominates the film industry, serving as the primary language for a large majority of movies. 

    2. Does the Average Vote Affect Popularity? - We will look for correlations between average vote and popularity metrics.

     There is a not so positive but positive correlation. Movies with an average vote between 5.5 and 8.5 tend to be more popular, more like they have a niche genre or a specific target audience. Additionally, popularity is not the same as quality in that a movie can be popular but it doesn't necessarily mean it is a better movie.

    3. Do higher budget movies return higher gross earnings? - We aim to provide insights by wagering the budgets and returns.

    These plots illustrate the relationship between production budgets and movie earnings, both domestically and worldwide.There is a positive correlation in that an increase in production budget is associated with an increase in worldwide gross as well as domestic gross.Note that some high-budget movies have achieved high gross earnings, while others have only reached average or lower gross figures. Hence our conclusion that a significant portion of movies operates within limited budgets, and their earnings tend to align with their budget levels.

    # Recommendations
    1. Look at reviews as they shed light on aspects like storytelling, acting, directing, or unique elements that resonated with critics. 
    2. Focus on story and execution as they are more crucial for a movie's success than just a high budget.
    3. Consider the genre and target audience. 
    4. Find the right balance between artistic vision and commercial viablity.Also explore niche markets. 
    5. If a specific language consistently shows higher popularity, consider prioritizing co-productions or films in that language. For example english.
